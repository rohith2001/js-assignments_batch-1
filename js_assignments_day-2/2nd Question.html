     Difference between VAR,LET AND CONST with Code examples:
       <h1>Var</h1>
        
       The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable.

      <br>Example: var a =10;

      <br>-->Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
    <br>-->>The scope of a JavaScript variable declared with var is its current execution context.
      <br>-->>The scope of a JavaScript variable declared outside the function is global.

      Code eg:
             <br>1. var a =10;
                    console.log(a); //output 10
              <br>2. var a =10;
                     var a =16;
                     console.log(a); //o/p:16

              It is similar to the Global variable present in other languages.

       <h1>Let</h1>
         The let statement declares a local variable in a block scope. It is similar to var, in that we can optionally initialize the variable.

        <br> Example: let x =10;
         The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
         It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.

        Code eg:
              <br>1.   { 
                 	let x=10;
               console.log(x); 
               }       // output 10

             <br> 2. {
                let x=10;
                let x=16;
                console.log(x);
               }    //throws error

           but for var it gives output as 16.

        <h1>Const</h1>
           
           const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned. The scope of const statement works similar to let statements.

             <br>Example: const y =10;
              Code eg:
                   <br>1. const MY_ROHITH =16;
                    console.log(MY_ROHITH);  //output 16 
                   <br>2. const MY_CODE =1;
                         console.log(MY_CODE);  //output 1
                         MY_CODE =2;           //throws type error
                         console.log(MY_CODE); 

               The code will throw an error when we try to reassign the existing const variable.
